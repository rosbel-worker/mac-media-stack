# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Mac Media Stack.

## How to Help

- **Bug reports**: Open an issue with your macOS version, Docker version, and the output of `bash scripts/health-check.sh`.
- **Feature requests**: Open an issue describing what you'd like and why.
- **Pull requests**: Fork the repo, make your changes on a branch, and open a PR. Keep changes focused on one thing.

## Guidelines

- Test your changes on a clean macOS install if possible.
- Don't commit `.env` files, API keys, or any credentials.
- Keep scripts compatible with both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.
- Match the existing code style (bash scripts use `set -e`, consistent formatting).

## Questions?

Open an issue. There are no dumb questions.
